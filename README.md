# Social-Buzz-Data-Insight

Social Buzz is a social media company that has existed for over five years. Due to its rapid growth rate and the large amount of data it generates, it is planning on going public. 
The business problem was to analyze their content categories data and highlight the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity. To also find relevant trends the data could provide. 

# The Process
1. Get the sample data that were stored in different tables
2. Clean out duplicates, and outliers and remove all irrelevant data needed for our analysis. Tools use is Excel
3. Merge all 3 tables to create 1 clean table for our analysis purpose
4. Analyze data for trends and insights
5. Share insight through a slide presentation to the client.

## Insight
I found the top 5 most popular categories as asked, but also went one step further by looking at other trends
- We found that animals and science are the two most popular categories, which means that most users like "real-life" and "factual" content
- I also found out that May had the most user engagement.
